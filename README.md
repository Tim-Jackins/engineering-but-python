# Engineering but Python

## A CircuitPython remix

Python is one of the most popular and versatile languages out there. From neural networks to data science to webservers Python is everywhere. So why not in our Microcontrollers? With the [Metro M4 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3382) you can totally do that! This repo contains a very rough draft of what engineering 1 at CHS might look like with the Metro instead of the Arduino
